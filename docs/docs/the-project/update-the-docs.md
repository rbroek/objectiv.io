First off, thank you for considering to update the Documentation pages. 

As some of the pages are automatically generated, below a very short How-To.

## Update Modeling docs
The [Modeling](/modeling/) docs are automatically generated from the comments in 
the [Bach source code](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/bach). 

Please go to the repository to make any edits to the comments in the source code, and submit a PR. We'll then 
re-generate the docs & deploy your changes.

[Make edits in the Bach repository](https://github.com/objectiv/objectiv-analytics/tree/main/bach)

## Update any other docs
All other documentation pages are (currently) not automatically generated. You can edit them in the repo 
below, submit a PR, and we'll then re-generate the docs & deploy your changes.
