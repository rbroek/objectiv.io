# Introduction
Objectivâ€™s Tracker enables you to track user behaviour for web applications, websites and other JavaScript-based applications. Instrumenting Objectiv's Tracker involves mapping your application to the [Open Taxonomy for Analytics](/taxonomy) to ensure the collected data is clean, well-structured and ready for modeling.


It is available for multiple frameworks and comes with a set of tools that enable you to validate your instrumentation against the taxonomy and get live debugging feedback in your IDE and console while your're developing.

## How-to Guides
To immediately jump into instrumenting your application, follow the step-by-step How-to Guides.

A number of web & mobile platforms and frameworks are currently supported, such as JS, React, React Native, 
and Angular - with more support coming.
