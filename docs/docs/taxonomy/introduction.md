# Introduction

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The Open Taxonomy of Analytics is [Objectiv's](https://objectiv.io/about/) proposal for a common way to collect, structure, and 
validate analytics data. Adoption of the Open Taxonomy enables data & models to be reused and allows data scientists to build on knowledge and practises of others.

Each common event type and the contexts in which they can happen are defined in a class, which describes their properties, requirements and relationships with other classes.

Objectiv's [Tracker](/tracking/introduction.md), [Collector](/tracking/core-concepts/collector) and [Bach](/modeling) (our modeling library) are built around the Open Taxonomy and support it out of the box.

## Core Principles
To help ensure that the open taxonomy will meet its goals, weâ€™ve created a set of core principles.

[Read up on the Core Principles](./core-principles.md)

## Core Concepts
To understand in more detail how the Taxonomy works, read about the underlying core concepts.

## Reference
To implement the taxonomy, all Contexts and Events are open and documented.

Objectiv and the Open Taxonomy are open-source and we're building it in public. Have opinions on where we should take this next? [Join us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/objectiv-io/shared_invite/zt-u6xma89w-DLDvOB7pQer5QUs5B_~5pg)
