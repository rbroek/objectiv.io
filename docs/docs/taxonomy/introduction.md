# Introduction

The Open Taxonomy of Analytics is [Objectiv's](https://objectiv.io/about/) proposal for a common way to collect, structure, and 
validate analytics data. Adoption of the Open Taxonomy enables data & models to be reused and allows data scientists to build on knowledge and practises of others.

Each common event type and the contexts in which they can happen are defined in a class, which describes their properties, requirements and relationships with other classes.

Objectiv's [Tracker](/tracking/introduction.md), [Collector](/tracking/core-concepts/collector) and [Bach](/modeling) (our modeling library) are built around the Open Taxonomy and support it out of the box.
